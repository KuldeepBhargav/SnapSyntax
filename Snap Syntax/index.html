                <p>There is a lot of misinformation regarding the subject of suicide. In becoming more aware and

                    ability to provide support to one who may be experiencing suicidal thoughts or actions.</p>

                    Fact: Although someone may look happy and “put together” on the outside, does not mean there is not
                    something else going on inside. Examples such as Robin Williams, Chester Bennington, Anthony
                    Bourdain
                    are examples of people who appeared well off and happy. We all wear the masks we want people to see.
                    Don’t brush off someone exhibits warning signs, even if they “have it all.”

                <h3>Myth: Suicide only affects those with Mental health Issues.</h3>
                <p>Fact: Talking about suicide may reduce one’s risk for completing suicide. It improves chances that
                    one might seek treatment. Being open about the subject matter can help one struggling with these
                    thoughts to view their circumstances differently. If someone is experiencing a mental health crisis
                    or severely depressed, asking if they are thinking about suicide can help. Please don’t hesitate to
                    aske questions and begin a conversation.</p>

                <h3>Myth: Suicide cannot be prevented.

                </h3>
                <p>Fact: Most suicides are preventable. Most of those who go from contemplating to acting are often
                    experiencing significant emotional pain, hopelessness, and do not see alternatives. Asking questions
                    and reducing access to lethal means are ways in which suicides can be prevented. Mental Health and
                    substance use treatments are other targeted interventions that could reduce ones urge to follow
                    through with suicide.</p>

                <h3>Myth: Psychotherapy and prescriptions don’t work.</h3>
                <p>Fact: Treatment does work. Learning how to cope with stressors, problems, mental health symptoms, and
                    other complications can greatly reduce one’s risk for suicide. Learning to process trauma and change
                    behaviors can also reduce risk. Certain prescription medications can also help in reducing one’s
                    urge. Finding the right treatment can be challenging and take time.</p>
